#SchmittTrigger Library#

The Schmitt trigger is a comparator application which switches the output positive when the input passes upward through a high reference (high_threshold) - The Output is switched back to negative when the input passes downward through a lower reference (low_threshold).

SchmittTrigger was originally written by Jerome Drouin and is now maintained by Jerome Drouin.
